# kaggle-AdvanceRegression
My exercise for machine learning regression.

Using Xgboost regression

### Things I learned from this project

1. Handling missing data using correct method depending on the data behaviour (many outliers, high correlation with another feature)
2. Depending on what type of data we collect, NaN value can mean different thing. So we need to understand clearly each feature so that we can handle in accordingly
3. Transforming feature is neccesary to improve the accuracy of the prediction model
4. Some numerical feature can be transformed into binary feature if neccesary. For example, the frequency of zero is about the same with non-zero value combined
